Format for messages passed between the DHT Servers and the P2P Clients.

On initialization, the client sends a message to the DHT Server to get the IP of the rest of the  servers.
DHT Server shall return the IDs and IPs of the other servers.

Send Message Format(From Client to DHT Server):
1;

Return Message Format(From DHT Server to Client):
1;/*ip of source*/;/*number of dht servers*/;/*DHT Server ID*/;/*DHT Server IP Address*/


After acquiring all of the server IPs, the client will send the name of the content it holds and its IP to the DHT corrosponding to the Hashed value:

Send Message Format(From Client to Server):
2;/*content name*/;/*client ip*/

Return Message Format(From Server to Client):
2;
Above is a confirmation so the client may implement packet loss and other checks.

The client can ask the DHT Server for some content and the DHT server will return the IP of the client with the content requested.

Send Message Format(From Client to Server):
3;/*content name*/

Recieve Message Format(From Server to Client):
3;/*content name*/;/*ip of client with content*/ || "404 Content Not Found"

When the Client exits, its IP is removed from all DHT Servers.
The client sends one packet to one DHT Server and the contacted server must forward the packet to the rest of the servers.

Send Message Format(From client to server and from server to server)
4;/*client IP*/
