# Peer-to-Peer File Sharing Application

CPS 706 - Computer Networks
Course Project

This application is a peer-to-peer service to transfer files between users.

## Getting Started

In order for the application to work, you have to first initialize a few DHT (Distributed Hash Table) servers that will store the IP addresses for each of the files in the network. Each of the clients need to initialize them serves using the code provided in the network that will allow them to get the IP of the desired files, and download/upload files as desired by the network.

Here are the instructions needed to begin the application:

### Prerequisites

First of all, please download all the files to your local machine.

The path to the executable for the DHT server is located at

```
~/Source Code/DHT Server/src/code files/
```

The path to the executable for the client is located at

```
~/Source Code/Client Server/src/app/
```

No special installation or set-up is necessary. Be prepaid to use your command line to run JAVA applications (JAVA compiler is required for such task).

### Initializing DHT Servers


To start the peer-to-peer network you first have to initialize 1 or more DHT server on the network that will store the IP addresses of the clients.
